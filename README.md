# Luna
Luna, A multipurpose discord bot with advanced sharding which can be the perfect template for your next bot!

## Self Hosting
For self hosting Luna, you need the following things:
- Node.js
- A VPS (Your computer will be not good if you want to host it permanently)
- Basic `Node.js` and `Javascript` knowledge
- MongoDB

Lets, get into it! First you need to download the repo, after downloading the repo navigate to the directory with the `cd` command (example - `cd Luna`). Then do `npm install`, it'll install all required dependencies automatically. Then you'll need to make a file named `.env` and then add 2 values named `BOT_TOKEN` and `URI`. The `BOT_TOKEN` contains your bot token and `URI` contains MongoDB uri. After this, simply write `npm start` and BOOM! Your bot is online! :D

### Hosting Methods
Here are the hosting methods supported by Luna:
- Heroku 
- Repl.it
You'll have to setup them by yourself!
# Important! 
If you're going to self host the bot please add some credits anywhere and also, You're not allowed to upload the self hosted bot to any botlist or something like that, you can use this bot Private or for your Community!
